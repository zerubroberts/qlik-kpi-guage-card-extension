I want you to create an extension in Qlik Sense. It needs to be minimal, modern and clean UI. I need maximum customization options, and it needs to be fully compatible with Qlik. 

Main Overview - 

- Itâ€™s supposed to be like a KPI Card - so starts with a background color and a border (with curve radius that customisable), shadow options
- Mock up is in screenshots > Mockup - KPI card.png
- Option to add multiple measures (all displayed as linear gauges)
- UPDATED: Only linear gauge chart type (removed donut charts)
- Dynamic grouping system - create multiple groups with customizable measure ranges (e.g., Group 1: measures 1-3, Group 2: measures 4-6)
- For each measure, have these options:
  - Title with positioning options (left or top of gauge)
  - Customizable title color and font
  - Adjustable gauge line height
  - Data label (like 40%)
  - Comparison indicator section (icon + % + background color)
  - Hover animations and effects
- Important - when clicking on a linear gauge, it expands to show a line chart with:
  - Clean, minimal design matching the overall style
  - Enhanced tooltips showing title, value, and % change with appropriate colors
  - Smooth transitions and animations
  - Fixed rendering issues for proper display
- Click functionality on each measure for line chart expansion
- Scrollbar for many measures with customizable spacing
- UI Improvements:
  - Sliders for numeric values (heights, widths, spacing)
  - Dropdowns for position selections
  - Color pickers for all color options
  - Modern hover effects and transitions


Build Process - 

- Organize everything into proper folders - with docs etc. Include Read.Me, usage doc
- Always give me a zip file to upload and test in Qlik.
- After every change, update your documentation - both usage, and the architecture/code overview doc.
- carefully update gitignore. No screenshots to be commited
